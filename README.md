# KeiserBike
A simple wrapper to pull data from a bluetooth enabled Keiser bike

A sample app to display some select data from a bluetooth enabled keiser bike.

The KeiserBikeManager class is a small wrapper around core bluetooth to only listen for keiser bikes.  The heavy lifting of parsing responses is handled by the return data struct.
